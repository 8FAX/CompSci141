# Sci141 @ RIT

This is a collection of work I did for Sci141 @ RIT. This repo was open when I was in the class with my prof knowing about it and will stay open until a staff member reaches out to me (lvs3021). This repo is meant to be a reference. I did very well in this class, but that being said, there are still a few errors in some of my work. I will not be pushing fixes for the work to the public repo because they are mostly me just not reading the docs for the labs fully. I was told there was a runtime error with one of the weeks but was never able to reproduce it myself, so IDC. Anyway, **do not just copy this work** to my understanding, the CS school at RIT keeps a record of work from students and runs new work through that record to look for cheating. By cheating, it will only end up poorly for you, and most likely end up removing this reference for people who need it.

Please **remember** that the work provided here is for **reference purposes only**, and should **not be copied directly**. Feel free to utilize it for inspiration and problem-solving. If you have any questions or need clarification on any part of the work, you are free to reach out to me on discord @8FA but **i most likely will not help you**. You should talk to your **TA and Prof about any questions you have**.
