Hello, I have talked with the professor, and after showing them my project, they said it was acceptable for it to be formatted in this way. 
I understand that in the original document, it says to overwrite the file from the in-lab portion of the assignment, over the break, I was 
slightly confused by this, so I came up with this structure that you see in my project, and after talking with the professor at the end of 
the break, they said it was acceptable. since it is not necessarily the exact file composition that was being looked for, I took the liberty 
of adding a few more sorting algorithms just for fun to make up for the fact that it's not necessarily the file format that was originally 
specified. You can use the store_location.py as the main entry point for the project. I have tried to document each sorting algorithm and 
the main document as much as possible, but I didn't think it would be possible to put a note inside the main document similar to this note 
without it causing more confusion.
