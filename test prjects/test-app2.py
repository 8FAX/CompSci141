# The code is performing several operations on the string variable `text`.
text = "this is a test"

#fake hack lmao
# The code block `i = 1 while i <= 5000: print(i * "0101000011") i = i + 1 print("Code: 404 Access
# granted.")` is a loop that prints a string of "0101000011" repeated `i` times, where `i` starts at 1
# and increments by 1 until it reaches 5000. After the loop finishes, it prints the message "Code: 404
# Access granted."
i = 1
while i <= 5000:
    print(i * "0101000011")
    i = i + 1
print("Code: 404 Access granted.")
